            <h2>App Concept - Spring 2020</h2>
            <p>
                A project with the Matthaei Botanical Gardens and Nichols Arboretum. 
                A group of Graduate and Undergraduate students came together under 
                the guidance of a Media Manager at Matthaei Botanical Gardens, to create 
                an app that helps the Ann Arbor Community find and utilize outdoor and natural spaces.
            </p>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p id="goal"> 
                To develop an app using ArcGIS that guides the local community through using natural 
                spaces to benefit their physical and mental health.
            </p>
            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>
                While we didn’t conduct any user surveying, much of our research was grounded 
                in the content for the app. Studying the benefits of being surrounded by nature. 
                However, if I were to restart the design process I would begin with a user survey.
            </p>
                <h4>Questions:</h4> 
            <ul>
                <li><p>RQ1: How do users currently utilize the natural spaces around Ann Arbor?</p></li>
                <li><p>RQ2: Would users benefit more from an educational platform or something with social elements?</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            I would survey students and community members with a series of questions that help answer 
            my research questions. These responses would help guide the team in critical decisions that 
            we ultimately made without potential user input.
            </p>
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>
             Using ArcGIS, our design options were limited. I took lead on the design as a sophomore, 
             with two freshman working with me. We didn’t have enough experience to tailor the app to our
              specific needs. Despite these limitations, we created a functioning demo app using ArcGIS AppStudio.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Given we only had a semester to work on this, meeting one hour a week.
                 There was so much more we could have accomplished. We spent much of our time curating 
                 content, mapping out the locations, researching the benefits of each of the locations.
                 Personally, I wish the design had gone much farther. ArcGIS allows the designer to embed 
                 the map feature into any app development software. After some experimenting I realized I 
                 couldn’t dive into learning a new software fast enough. ArcGIS’s mapping is also extremely 
                 limited as far as the interaction with the map itself. The pop-up box is frustrating and 
                 cluttered, with little room for modifications. The welcome screen is an extra set. Theres not
                  much opportunity for adding more functions or adding a social element.
                  We all had a vision for this project, but limited time, a pandemic, and a environmental
                   major heavy team, our dream was cut short. I wish to continue this project again in the 
                   future with more emphasis on connecting the user with a natural spot rather than telling 
                   them what to do when they get there.
